Situated about 10 miles west of Kemmerer, Fossil Butte is a ruggedly impressive
topographic feature that rises sharply some 1000 feet above Twin Creek Valley
to an elevation of more than 7500 feet above sea level. The butte is located 
just north of US 30N and the Union Pacific Railroad, which traverse the valley. 
''',
'''At the base of Fossil Butte are the bright red, purple, yellow and gray beds 
of the Wasatch Formation. Eroded portions of these horizontal beds slope 
gradually upward from the valley floor and steepen abruptly. Overlying them and 
extending to the top of the butte are the much steeper buff-to-white beds of 
the Green River Formation, which are about 300 feet thick.''',
'''The monument contains 8198 acres and protects a portion of the largest 
deposit of freshwater fish fossils in the world. The richest fossil fish 
deposits are found in multiple limestone layers, which lie some 100 feet below 
the top of the butte. The fossils represent several varieties of perch, as well 
as other freshwater genera and herring similar to those in modern oceans. 
Other fish such as paddlefish, garpike and stingray are also present.''']
